# Chaos 0.8 compatibility

## Chaos 0.8.0 interoperability

Chaos 0.8.0 adds:

- multi-stage chaos workflows: steps, steady-state health checks, parallel
  branches, approval gates that can be resumed, and reusable templates
- declarative YAML/JSON/TOML experiments, with validation that never executes
  targets and cron schedule previews
- `Scope` explosion-radius control (steps, providers and exclusions) on every
  fault
- a topology fuzzer that weights fault placement by fan-out

Native event IDs and fault types are unchanged. Workflow provenance
(`detail.workflow`) and an optional `ChaosReport.workflow` summary are
additive. A workflow's steps merge into one native report for contracts and
AIOS export.

See the [v0.8 guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/blob/v0.8.0/docs/v0.8.md)
and the [offline examples](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/tree/v0.8.0/examples/workflows).
Workflow statuses, health checks and fuzz outcomes are resilience evidence.
They are not scores, release gates or proof of containment. No new shared
schema, automatic adapter or hosted execution capability is introduced.

Merged workflow exports validate against the v0.4 Run schema and semantic checker. The workflow summary is a producer-local extension member, not a normative Workflow object or a schema change. Specification maturity and conformance claims are unchanged. No spec release is needed.
